## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Transaction Validation Complexity**
   - Risk: Implementing comprehensive transaction validation may be more complex than anticipated
   - Mitigation: Start with basic validation and incrementally add more sophisticated checks

2. **Network Protocol Stability**
   - Risk: Network protocols may have edge cases that cause instability
   - Mitigation: Implement extensive testing and simulation of network conditions

3. **Database Performance**
   - Risk: Database performance may degrade with large blockchain data
   - Mitigation: Implement proper indexing, pruning, and optimization from the start

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Risk: Cryptographic or protocol-level security issues
   - Mitigation: Conduct formal security audits by third-party experts

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **API Security**
   - Risk: API endpoints may contain security vulnerabilities
   - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive input validation and security testing

2. **Environmental Calculation Accuracy**
   - Risk: Environmental impact calculations may not be accurate
   - Mitigation: Base calculations on established methodologies and provide transparency

3. **Lightning Network Complexity**
   - Risk: Lightning Network implementation is complex and may take longer than anticipated
   - Mitigation: Break down implementation into smaller, manageable components
