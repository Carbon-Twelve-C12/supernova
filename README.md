## Overview

Supernova is a production-grade Proof-of-Work blockchain written in Rust. It is designed to address three of the most significant challenges facing the blockchain industry: the existential threat of quantum computing, the environmental impact of PoW consensus, and the demand for scalable, low-cost transactions. Built with a security-first approach, Supernova implements comprehensive security testing to ensure unparalleled reliability.

For a more detailed breakdown of the project's status, architecture, and goals, please see the [Supernova Overview](docs/supernova_overview.md) document.

Our primary goal is to provide a secure, scalable, and sustainable platform for the next generation of decentralized applications.

## Key Innovations

### 1. **End-to-End Quantum Resistance**
Supernova is engineered with an architectural commitment to post-quantum security. We have replaced classical cryptographic primitives (ECDSA, secp256k1) with NIST-standardized post-quantum schemes across the entire protocol stack.
-   **Primary Signatures:** **ML-DSA (Dilithium)** for general on-chain transactions.
-   **Stateless Signatures:** **SPHINCS+** for high-security applications like wallet recovery.
-   **Key Exchange:** **ML-KEM (Kyber)** for securing the P2P communication layer.
-   **Hashing:** **SHA3-512** for resistance against Grover's algorithm.

### 2. **A Quantum-Resistant Lightning Network**
We have implemented a Lightning Network that is quantum-secure by design, addressing a critical vulnerability in second-layer scaling solutions.
-   **Quantum Channels:** All channel operations (funding, commitment, and closing transactions) are secured with Dilithium signatures.
-   **Quantum-Safe HTLCs:** Hash Time-Locked Contracts use SHA3-512 hashes, ensuring that payments are secure even from quantum adversaries.
-   **Quantum Onion Routing:** Payment privacy is protected using a post-quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) for layer encryption.

### 3. **Carbon-Negative Proof-of-Work**
Supernova's PoW consensus mechanism is designed to be environmentally sustainable.
-   **Real-Time Emissions Tracking:** An on-chain system tracks the carbon footprint of mining operations in real-time.
-   **Green Mining Incentives:** Miners who use verified renewable energy sources receive a block reward bonus, creating an economic incentive for sustainable practices.
-   **Environmental Treasury:** A portion of transaction fees is automatically allocated to a decentralized treasury that funds carbon offset projects.
