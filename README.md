## Known Issues

The current implementation has several known issues:

1. **Thread Safety**: The main node binary has improved thread safety but may still have some edge-case issues when handling a high number of concurrent requests.
2. **Warnings**: The codebase contains numerous unused import and field warnings that need cleanup.
3. **Network Synchronization**: Some complex network tests need refinement for better reliability.
4. **Environmental Data**: The emissions factor database needs expansion with more regions and grid-level data.

## Project Status

Supernova is currently at version 0.1.0 (alpha). The core libraries are functional but additional work is needed on:

- API development
- Advanced network features
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Carbon offset marketplace integration
