## Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-deployment**
   - [ ] Verify all tests pass
   - [ ] Review security audit
   - [ ] Check disk space (>10GB)
   - [ ] Check memory (>4GB)
   - [ ] Install Docker & Docker Compose

2. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Run deployment script: `./deploy_testnet.sh`
   - [ ] Verify all containers start
   - [ ] Check service health endpoints
   - [ ] Monitor initial logs

3. **Post-deployment**
   - [ ] Verify block production
   - [ ] Test faucet operation
   - [ ] Check monitoring dashboards
   - [ ] Test API endpoints
   - [ ] Verify environmental oracle

## Monitoring Checklist

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] Block height progression
- [ ] Network hash rate
- [ ] Transaction throughput
- [ ] Node connectivity
- [ ] Memory usage
- [ ] Disk usage
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Environmental metrics

### Alert Thresholds
- Block time deviation > 20%
- Node disconnections > 50%
- Memory usage > 80%
- Disk usage > 90%
- API errors > 5%
- Zero blocks in 10 minutes

## Communication Plan

### Launch Announcement
