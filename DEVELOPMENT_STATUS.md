# SuperNova Development Status - v0.6.0-dev

## Project Status Summary

Supernova is currently in active development with a focus on implementing the core blockchain functionality with enhanced features for security, scalability, and environmental considerations.

Current version: **0.6.0-dev**

## Component Completion Status

| Component | Percentage Complete | Status |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Core Structures | 75% | Implementation of basic data structures complete, but many advanced features still in progress |
| Consensus | 60% | Basic PoW consensus implemented, but quantum resistance features still in development |
| Validation | 70% | Transaction and block validation implemented with remaining issues to be fixed |
| Mempool | 60% | Basic functionality implemented, advanced features pending |
| Networking | 40% | Initial P2P implementation, more work needed on protocol handlers |
| Storage | 65% | Block and UTXO storage implemented, but needs optimization |
| Environmental Monitoring | 60% | Basic frameworks in place, but integration points need completion |
| Security | 50% | Core security features implemented, but advanced protections still in dev |
| CLI & RPC | 30% | Basic CLI commands available, RPC interface in early stages |
| Documentation | 60% | Core documentation written, but needs more technical details |

## Current Development Priorities

1. **Fix compilation errors**: The codebase currently has multiple compilation errors related to type mismatches, missing implementations, and structural issues.

2. **Complete validation module**: Ensure all validation checks for transactions and blocks are properly implemented and tested.

3. **Finalize environmental monitoring**: Complete the integration between the blockchain and environmental monitoring systems.

4. **Implement quantum resistance**: Complete the post-quantum cryptography implementations.

5. **Improve test coverage**: Add comprehensive tests for all major components.

## Known Issues

- Type conflicts between modules causing compilation errors
- Missing implementations of required traits
- Environmental and validation module integration issues
- Incomplete quantum cryptography implementations
- Security mitigation features requiring further development

## Next Steps for Production Readiness

To move SuperNova towards production readiness, the following actions are recommended:

1. Resolve all compilation errors with a focus on fixing type conflicts
2. Complete the validation and environmental modules with proper integration
3. Implement complete test coverage for core functionality
4. Enhance documentation with technical specifications
5. Complete the quantum resistance features
6. Perform security audits on the codebase
7. Optimize performance for critical paths

## Version Roadmap

- **v0.6.0**: Complete core functionalities and fix compilation errors
- **v0.7.0**: Finalize validation, environmental features, and quantum resistance
- **v0.8.0**: Performance optimization and security improvements
- **v0.9.0**: Testnet release
- **v1.0.0**: Production-ready Mainnet release

## Recent Progress

- Fixed multiple compilation errors related to struct field mismatches
- Implemented more comprehensive environmental monitoring features
- Improved transaction validation with better error handling
- Added quantum-resistant signature scheme frameworks
- Updated transparency reporting for environmental metrics
