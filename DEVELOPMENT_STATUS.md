# SuperNova Development Status

## Current Status: Development Version 0.5.0

The SuperNova blockchain is currently in active development with significant progress made on core components but many advanced features still in development or stub implementation.

## Component Status Overview

- **Core Data Structures**: ~70% complete - Basic structures implemented, advanced features partial
- **Transaction Processing**: ~75% complete - Core validation working, advanced features lacking
- **Mempool Management**: ~60% complete - Basic functionality present, optimizations needed
- **Block Validation**: ~65% complete - Basic validation works, consensus rules incomplete
- **Merkle Tree**: 100% complete - Fully implemented with verification
- **Chain State**: ~70% complete - Basic functionality present, fork handling incomplete
- **Storage Layer**: ~65% complete - Basic storage working, optimizations needed
- **Network Protocol**: ~40% complete - Basic design implemented, most features incomplete
- **Cryptography**: ~60% complete - Core cryptography working, quantum features partial
- **Environmental System**: ~40% complete - Basic framework, most features incomplete
- **Security Features**: ~35% complete - Basic security, advanced mitigations missing
- **Lightning Network**: ~20% complete - Early development, most features incomplete
- **Testnet Environment**: 100% complete - Docker-based testnet simulation environment

## Current Development Focus

1. Resolving compilation issues in core components
2. Completing essential blockchain functionality
3. Enhancing transaction and block validation
4. Implementing functional P2P networking
5. Replacing stub implementations with working code
6. Evolving the testnet from simulation to functional test network

## Next Milestone: Version 0.6.0

Expected to include:
- Completed core blockchain functionality
- Enhanced transaction validation
- Improved chain state management
- Fixed compilation issues
- Advanced P2P networking implementation
