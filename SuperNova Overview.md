## Core Implementation Details

### Block Structure and Implementation

The core block structure is implemented with comprehensive validation and serialization mechanisms:

```rust
pub struct Block {
    header: BlockHeader,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
}

impl Block {
    pub fn new(
        version: u32,
        prev_block_hash: [u8; 32],
        transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
        target: u32,
    ) -> Self {
        let merkle_root = Self::calculate_merkle_root(&transactions);
        
        Self {
            header: BlockHeader::new(version, prev_block_hash, merkle_root, target),
            transactions,
        }
    }

    pub fn hash(&self) -> [u8; 32] {
        self.header.hash()
    }

    pub fn increment_nonce(&mut self) {
        self.header.increment_nonce();
    }

    fn calculate_merkle_root(transactions: &[Transaction]) -> [u8; 32] {
        let tx_bytes: Vec<Vec<u8>> = transactions
            .iter()
            .map(|tx| bincode::serialize(&tx).unwrap())
            .collect();

        let tree = MerkleTree::new(&tx_bytes);
        tree.root_hash().unwrap_or([0u8; 32])
    }

    pub fn validate(&self) -> bool {
        let hash = self.header.hash();
        let target = self.header.target;
        
        let hash_value = u32::from_be_bytes([hash[0], hash[1], hash[2], hash[3]]);
        
        if hash_value > target {
            return false;
        }

        let calculated_root = Self::calculate_merkle_root(&self.transactions);
        if calculated_root != self.header.merkle_root {
            return false;
        }

        true
    }
}
```

### Mining System

The mining system implements a multi-threaded approach to find valid blocks:

```rust
// Worker implementation for mining a block
pub struct MiningWorker {
    id: usize,
    template: Arc<BlockTemplate>,
    max_nonce: u32,
    metrics: Arc<MiningMetrics>,
}

impl MiningWorker {
    pub fn run(&mut self) -> Option<Block> {
        let mut block = self.template.create_block();
        let target_hash = block.target();
        let start_time = Instant::now();
        let mut hashes = 0;
        
        for nonce in 0..self.max_nonce {
            block.set_nonce(nonce);
            let hash = block.hash();
            hashes += 1;
            
            if hash_meets_target(&hash, target_hash) {
                self.metrics.report_block_found(self.id, nonce, start_time.elapsed());
                return Some(block);
            }
            
            // Update metrics periodically
            if hashes % 10000 == 0 {
                self.metrics.update_hash_rate(self.id, hashes, start_time.elapsed());
                hashes = 0;
            }
        }
        
        None
    }
}
```

### Transaction Processing System

The transaction system implements comprehensive UTXO management and validation:

```rust
pub struct Transaction {
    version: u32,
    inputs: Vec<TransactionInput>,
    outputs: Vec<TransactionOutput>,
    locktime: u32,
}

impl Transaction {
    pub fn new(
        version: u32,
        inputs: Vec<TransactionInput>,
        outputs: Vec<TransactionOutput>,
        locktime: u32,
    ) -> Self {
        Self {
            version,
            inputs,
            outputs,
            locktime,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn hash(&self) -> [u8; 32] {
        let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
        hasher.update(&bincode::serialize(&self).unwrap());
        let result = hasher.finalize();
        let mut hash = [0u8; 32];
        hash.copy_from_slice(&result);
        hash
    }
    
    pub fn calculate_fee_rate(&self, get_output: impl Fn(&[u8; 32], u32) -> Option<TransactionOutput>) -> Option<u64> {
        let mut input_value = 0;
        for input in &self.inputs {
            let outpoint = &input.outpoint;
            let output = get_output(&outpoint.txid, outpoint.vout)?;
            input_value += output.value;
        }
        
        let output_value: u64 = self.outputs.iter().map(|o| o.value).sum();
        if input_value <= output_value {
            return None;
        }
        
        let fee = input_value - output_value;
        let size = bincode::serialize(&self).ok()?.len() as u64;
        
        if size == 0 {
            return None;
        }
        
        Some(fee / size)
    }
}
```

### Advanced Difficulty Adjustment

The difficulty adjustment algorithm provides target calculation:

```rust
// Difficulty adjustment algorithm
pub struct DifficultyAdjuster {
    timestamps: Vec<u64>,
    target_timespan: u64,
    last_adjustment_time: u64,
    current_target: u32,
}

impl DifficultyAdjuster {
    pub fn new(initial_target: u32, target_timespan: u64) -> Self {
        Self {
            timestamps: Vec::new(),
            target_timespan,
            last_adjustment_time: SystemTime::now()
                .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
                .unwrap()
                .as_secs(),
            current_target: initial_target,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn add_block_timestamp(&mut self, timestamp: u64) {
        self.timestamps.push(timestamp);
        
        // Keep only the last N timestamps
        const MAX_TIMESTAMPS: usize = 100;
        if self.timestamps.len() > MAX_TIMESTAMPS {
            self.timestamps.remove(0);
        }
    }
    
    pub fn adjust_difficulty(&mut self, height: u64) -> u32 {
        if height % 10 != 0 || self.timestamps.len() < 10 {
            return self.current_target;
        }
        
        let mut timestamps = self.timestamps.clone();
        timestamps.sort();
        
        // Get median time
        let median_index = timestamps.len() / 2;
        let median_time = timestamps[median_index];
        
        // Calculate actual timespan
        let actual_timespan = median_time - self.last_adjustment_time;
        
        // Update last adjustment time
        self.last_adjustment_time = median_time;
        
        // Adjust target based on ratio of actual to target timespan
        let mut new_target = self.current_target;
        
        if actual_timespan < self.target_timespan / 4 {
            // Time is too short, increase difficulty
            new_target = new_target.saturating_sub(new_target / 4);
        } else if actual_timespan > self.target_timespan * 4 {
            // Time is too long, decrease difficulty
            new_target = new_target.saturating_add(new_target / 4);
        } else {
            // Normal adjustment
            let ratio = actual_timespan as f64 / self.target_timespan as f64;
            let adjustment = (self.current_target as f64 * (ratio - 1.0)) as i32;
            new_target = (self.current_target as i32 + adjustment) as u32;
        }
        
        self.current_target = new_target;
        new_target
    }
}
```

### UTXO Set Management

Efficient UTXO tracking and state management:

```rust
pub struct ChainState {
    db: Arc<BlockchainDB>,
    utxo_set: Arc<DashMap<OutPoint, TransactionOutput>>,
    height: AtomicU64,
    best_block_hash: RwLock<[u8; 32]>,
    total_difficulty: AtomicU64,
}

impl ChainState {
    pub fn new(db: Arc<BlockchainDB>) -> Result<Self, StorageError> {
        // Initialize from database
        let height = db.get_height()?;
        let best_hash = db.get_best_block_hash()?;
        let total_difficulty = db.get_total_difficulty()?;
        
        // Initialize UTXO set from database
        let utxo_set = Arc::new(DashMap::new());
        for (key, value) in db.scan_utxos()? {
            let outpoint = bincode::deserialize(&key)?;
            let output = bincode::deserialize(&value)?;
            utxo_set.insert(outpoint, output);
        }
        
        Ok(Self {
            db,
            utxo_set,
            height: AtomicU64::new(height),
            best_block_hash: RwLock::new(best_hash),
            total_difficulty: AtomicU64::new(total_difficulty),
        })
    }
    
    pub fn get_height(&self) -> u64 {
        self.height.load(Ordering::Relaxed)
    }
    
    pub fn get_best_block_hash(&self) -> [u8; 32] {
        *self.best_block_hash.read().unwrap()
    }
    
    pub fn get_total_difficulty(&self) -> u64 {
        self.total_difficulty.load(Ordering::Relaxed)
    }
    
    pub fn get_db(&self) -> &Arc<BlockchainDB> {
        &self.db
    }
    
    pub async fn process_block(&mut self, block: Block) -> Result<bool, StorageError> {
        // Validate the block
        if !self.validate_block(&block)? {
            return Ok(false);
        }
        
        // Get previous block info
        let prev_hash = block.prev_block_hash();
        let prev_block_info = self.db.get_block_info(&prev_hash)?;
        
        // Calculate new height and difficulty
        let new_height = prev_block_info.height + 1;
        let new_difficulty = prev_block_info.total_difficulty + calculate_block_work(block.target());
        
        // Process transactions
        for tx in block.transactions() {
            // Remove spent UTXOs
            for input in tx.inputs() {
                self.utxo_set.remove(&input.outpoint);
            }
            
            // Add new UTXOs
            for (i, output) in tx.outputs().iter().enumerate() {
                let outpoint = OutPoint {
                    txid: tx.hash(),
                    vout: i as u32,
                };
                self.utxo_set.insert(outpoint, output.clone());
            }
        }
        
        // Store block in database
        self.db.store_block(&block, new_height, new_difficulty)?;
        
        // Update chain state
        if new_difficulty > self.total_difficulty.load(Ordering::Relaxed) {
            self.height.store(new_height, Ordering::Relaxed);
            *self.best_block_hash.write().unwrap() = block.hash();
            self.total_difficulty.store(new_difficulty, Ordering::Relaxed);
            return Ok(true);
        }
        
        Ok(false)
    }
}
```

### Advanced Cryptographic Features

SuperNova integrates forward-looking cryptographic features to enhance privacy and future-proof the blockchain against quantum attacks:

#### Post-Quantum Cryptography

The blockchain implements multiple quantum-resistant signature schemes to ensure security in a post-quantum era:

```rust
/// Supported quantum-resistant signature schemes
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum QuantumScheme {
    /// CRYSTALS-Dilithium signature scheme
    Dilithium,
    /// FALCON signature scheme
    Falcon,
    /// SPHINCS+ signature scheme
    Sphincs,
    /// Hybrid scheme (classical + post-quantum)
    Hybrid(ClassicalScheme),
}

pub struct QuantumKeyPair {
    /// The public key
    pub public_key: Vec<u8>,
    /// The private key (sensitive information)
    private_key: Vec<u8>,
    /// Parameters used for this key pair
    pub parameters: QuantumParameters,
}

impl QuantumKeyPair {
    /// Sign a message using the quantum-resistant secret key.
    pub fn sign(&self, message: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>, QuantumError> {
        match &self.parameters.scheme {
            QuantumScheme::Dilithium => {
                match self.parameters.security_level {
                    SecurityLevel::Low => {
                        let sk = pqcrypto_dilithium::dilithium2::SecretKey::from_bytes(&self.private_key)
                            .map_err(|e| QuantumError::InvalidKey(format!("Invalid Dilithium secret key: {}", e)))?;
                        let signature = pqcrypto_dilithium::dilithium2::detached_sign(message, &sk);
                        Ok(signature.as_bytes().to_vec())
                    },
                    // Additional security levels...
                }
            },
            QuantumScheme::Falcon => {
                // Implementation for Falcon would go here
                // For now, return CryptoOperationFailed error with an informative message
                Err(QuantumError::CryptoOperationFailed("Falcon signature implementation pending".to_string()))
            },
            // Other schemes...
        }
    }
    
    /// Verify a signature using the quantum-resistant public key.
    pub fn verify(&self, message: &[u8], signature: &[u8]) -> Result<bool, QuantumError> {
        // Implementation for verification...
    }
}
```

### Environmental Impact Measurement System

The blockchain includes comprehensive features for tracking and mitigating environmental impact:

```rust
/// Emissions tracker for the SuperNova network
pub struct EmissionsTracker {
    /// Network hashrate by geographic region
    region_hashrates: HashMap<Region, HashRate>,
    /// Emissions factors by region (gCO2e/kWh)
    region_emission_factors: HashMap<Region, EmissionFactor>,
    /// Energy efficiency of mining hardware over time
    hardware_efficiency: HashMap<HardwareType, Efficiency>,
    /// Reported renewable energy percentage by mining pool
    pool_energy_info: HashMap<PoolId, PoolEnergyInfo>,
    /// Global configuration for the emissions tracker
    config: EmissionsConfig,
}

impl EmissionsTracker {
    /// Calculate total network emissions for a given time period using CBECI methodology
    pub fn calculate_network_emissions(&self, start_time: DateTime<Utc>, end_time: DateTime<Utc>) -> Result<Emissions, EmissionsError> {
        // Implementation using Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index methodology
        // to calculate energy usage and emissions based on network hashrate
    }
    
    /// Estimate emissions for a single transaction
    pub fn estimate_transaction_emissions(&self, transaction: &Transaction) -> Result<Emissions, EmissionsError> {
        // Calculate emissions for processing a single transaction
    }
}
