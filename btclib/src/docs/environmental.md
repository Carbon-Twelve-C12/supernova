# SuperNova Environmental Features

This document provides an overview of the environmental impact measurement and mitigation features in the SuperNova blockchain.

## Overview

The SuperNova blockchain includes comprehensive features for measuring and mitigating the environmental impact of blockchain operations. These features are designed to:

1. Measure the carbon emissions associated with mining and transaction processing
2. Allocate a portion of transaction fees to environmental projects
3. Incentivize miners to use renewable energy sources
4. Track and report on environmental metrics

## Emissions Tracking

The emissions tracking system calculates the carbon footprint of the network based on:

- Regional electricity grid carbon intensity
- Network hashrate distribution
- Mining hardware efficiency
- Transaction processing requirements

### Renewable Energy Certificate Prioritization

SuperNova prioritizes Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) over carbon credits for several important reasons:

1. **Direct source mitigation**: RECs address the primary source of emissions in mining operations (electricity consumption) rather than offsetting emissions after they occur.
2. **Mining relevance**: Since blockchain mining emissions are primarily from electricity usage, RECs are more directly relevant than general carbon credits.
3. **Grid transformation**: Purchasing RECs contributes to increasing renewable energy capacity on the grid.
4. **Verification standards**: RECs typically have established verification mechanisms with regulatory oversight.

The implementation includes tiered status for miners:
- **REC Miners**: Miners who source certified renewable energy directly or through RECs
- **Offset Miners**: Miners who purchase carbon credits to offset their emissions
- **Standard Miners**: Miners without environmental commitments

REC Miners receive higher incentives and recognition in the SuperNova system compared to Offset Miners, reflecting this prioritization.

### Basic Usage Example

```rust
use btclib::environmental::{EmissionsCalculator, EmissionsTimePeriod};

// Calculate network emissions
let calculator = EmissionsCalculator::new();
let daily_emissions = calculator.calculate_network_emissions(
    EmissionsTimePeriod::Daily
)?;

println!("Daily network emissions: {} tons CO2e", daily_emissions);
```

## Emissions Factor Database

The emissions factor database provides carbon intensity data for electricity grids around the world. This database:

- Is regularly updated from authoritative sources like IEA and national grid operators
- Provides regional granularity for more accurate calculations
- Includes temporal variations to account for seasonal changes in grid composition
- Supports both backward-looking historical data and forward-looking projections

## Mining Hardware Specification System

The hardware specification system allows miners to:

- Register the specific hardware they use for mining
- Provide verifiable information about energy consumption
- Receive more accurate emissions calculations
- Demonstrate energy efficiency improvements

Hardware specifications are verified through a combination of manufacturer specifications, third-party certifications, and on-chain performance metrics.

## Environmental Treasury System

A portion of transaction fees is allocated to the environmental treasury, which funds:

- Renewable energy projects
- Carbon offset programs
- Environmental research and development
- Climate change mitigation initiatives

### Fee Allocation Example

```rust
use btclib::environmental::{EnvironmentalTreasury, ProjectType};

// Allocate fees to environmental projects
let treasury = EnvironmentalTreasury::new();
treasury.allocate_fees(
    1000,  // Amount in sats
    ProjectType::RenewableEnergy  // Prioritized over carbon offsets
)?;
```

## Green Miner Incentives

Miners who use renewable energy sources receive fee discounts based on their percentage of renewable energy use:

- 100% renewable energy: 50% fee discount
- 75% renewable energy: 35% fee discount
- 50% renewable energy: 20% fee discount
- 25% renewable energy: 10% fee discount

### Advanced Incentive Mechanisms

SuperNova implements a tiered incentive system that prioritizes RECs over carbon credits:

1. **REC-First Discounts**: Higher fee discounts for REC-backed mining operations
2. **Block Reward Enhancements**: Additional rewards for REC-verified miners
3. **Reputation System**: On-chain reputation scores with higher weighting for renewable energy certificates
4. **Green Certificates**: Non-transferable tokens that represent verified renewable energy use
5. **Dashboard Priority**: Prominent display of REC miners on the environmental dashboard

### Miner Registration Example

```rust
use btclib::environmental::{GreenMinerRegistry, EnergySource, CertificationType};

// Register a green miner with RECs (prioritized)
let registry = GreenMinerRegistry::new();
registry.register_miner(
    "miner_public_key",
    75.0,  // Percentage of renewable energy
    EnergySource::Solar,
    CertificationType::REC  // Prioritized over CertificationType::CarbonOffset
)?;
```

## Environmental Dashboard

The dashboard provides visualizations of:

- Network emissions over time
- Regional distribution of mining operations
- Renewable energy adoption among miners
- Environmental treasury allocations
- Transaction-level emissions data
- REC vs. carbon offset comparison metrics

### Dashboard Example

```rust
use btclib::environmental::{EnvironmentalDashboard, MetricsTimePeriod};

// Generate environmental metrics
let dashboard = EnvironmentalDashboard::new();
let metrics = dashboard.generate_metrics(
    MetricsTimePeriod::Monthly
)?;

// Export metrics as JSON
let json = dashboard.export_metrics_json(metrics)?;
```

## Configuration Options

Environmental features can be enabled in the blockchain configuration file:

```json
{
  "environmental": {
    "enabled": true,
    "emissions_tracking": true,
    "treasury_allocation_percentage": 1.0,
    "green_miner_incentives": true,
    "rec_prioritization": true,
    "dashboard": true
  }
}
```

## Integration with Block Explorer

The environmental data can be integrated with a block explorer to display:

- Emissions data for each block
- Miner environmental performance
- Transaction carbon footprint
- Environmental treasury allocations
- REC verification status for miners

## Future Development Plans

Future enhancements to the environmental framework include:

1. Integration with major renewable energy certificate providers for automatic verification
2. Enhanced geographic coverage of emissions factors
3. Support for hardware-specific energy models
4. Advanced reporting tools for ESG compliance
5. Expanded incentive mechanisms for renewable energy adoption
6. Direct REC marketplace integration within the protocol
