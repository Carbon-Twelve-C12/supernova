## 3. Mining Rewards & Emissions Schedule

### 3.1 Block Rewards

Mining rewards follow a halving schedule similar to Bitcoin, but with environmental adjustments:

- **Initial Block Reward**: 50 NOVA
- **Block Time**: 2.5 minutes (average)
- **Blocks Per Day**: ~576
- **Initial Daily Emission**: ~28,800 NOVA
- **Halving Schedule**: Every 840,000 blocks (approximately 4 years)

### 3.2 Reward Schedule

| Period | Blocks | Block Reward | Daily Issuance | Period Supply | % of Total |
|--------|--------|--------------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Year 1-4 | 0-840,000 | 50 NOVA | 28,800 NOVA | 8,400,000 NOVA | 20.00% |
| Year 5-8 | 840,001-1,680,000 | 25 NOVA | 14,400 NOVA | 4,200,000 NOVA | 10.00% |
| Year 9-12 | 1,680,001-2,520,000 | 12.5 NOVA | 7,200 NOVA | 2,100,000 NOVA | 5.00% |
| Year 13-16 | 2,520,001-3,360,000 | 6.25 NOVA | 3,600 NOVA | 1,050,000 NOVA | 2.50% |
| Year 17-20 | 3,360,001-4,200,000 | 3.125 NOVA | 1,800 NOVA | 525,000 NOVA | 1.25% |

The emission continues with halvings every 840,000 blocks until all 16,800,000 mining reward tokens are distributed (approximately 20-24 years).
