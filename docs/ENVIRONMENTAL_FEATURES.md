## Technical Implementation

### Environmental Data Structure

```rust
pub struct EnvironmentalData {
    pub carbon_emissions: CarbonEmissions,
    pub renewable_percentage: f32,
    pub carbon_credits: Vec<CarbonCredit>,
    pub oracle_signatures: Vec<OracleSignature>,
    pub verification_status: VerificationStatus,
}

pub struct CarbonEmissions {
    pub total_grams: u64,
    pub per_transaction: f64,
    pub net_emissions: i64,  // Can be negative!
    pub calculation_method: CalculationMethod,
}
```

### Oracle Consensus System

```rust
pub struct OracleConsensus {
    pub oracles: Vec<EnvOracle>,
    pub consensus_threshold: f32,  // 0.67 (67%)
    pub fault_tolerance: f32,      // 0.33 (33%)
    pub update_frequency: Duration,
}
```

### Manual Verification Process

For large-scale mining operations (>10MW), Supernova implements a quarterly manual review:

```rust
pub struct ManualVerification {
    pub facility_id: FacilityId,
    pub capacity_mw: f64,
    pub renewable_sources: Vec<RenewableSource>,
    pub verification_documents: Vec<Document>,
    pub foundation_signature: DigitalSignature,
    pub next_review_date: Timestamp,
}
```

## Environmental Features

### 1. Carbon Emissions Tracking

**Real-time Calculation**:
- Energy consumption per hash
- Regional carbon intensity data
- Network-wide emissions aggregation
- Per-transaction carbon footprint

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub fn calculate_carbon_footprint(&self) -> CarbonFootprint {
    let energy_consumed = self.calculate_energy_consumption();
    let carbon_intensity = self.get_regional_carbon_intensity();
    let emissions = energy_consumed * carbon_intensity;
    
    CarbonFootprint {
        total_emissions: emissions,
        offset_credits: self.carbon_credits.total(),
        net_emissions: emissions - self.carbon_credits.total(),
        renewable_percentage: self.renewable_percentage,
    }
}
```

### 2. Green Mining Incentives

**Bonus Structure**:
- 25% bonus: 50-74% renewable energy
- 50% bonus: 75-94% renewable energy  
- 75% bonus: 95%+ renewable energy

**Verification Methods**:
1. **Automated REC Validation**: Real-time certificate verification
2. **Oracle Consensus**: Multiple data sources confirm renewable usage
3. **Manual Review**: Quarterly audits for large installations
4. **Smart Metering**: Direct integration with energy providers

### 3. Environmental Treasury

**Fund Allocation**:
- 40% - Direct carbon credit purchases
- 30% - Renewable energy development
- 20% - Environmental research grants
- 10% - Operational and audit costs

**Governance**:
- Transparent on-chain voting
- Quarterly impact reports
- Community proposals for fund usage
- External audit requirements

### 4. Lightning Network Green Routing

**Environmental Optimization**:
```rust
pub struct GreenRoute {
    pub path: Vec<ChannelId>,
    pub total_fees: Amount,
    pub carbon_footprint: f64,
    pub green_score: f32,  // 0.0 to 1.0
}
```

**Features**:
- Carbon-conscious path selection
- Green node prioritization
- Environmental impact certificates
- Incentives for sustainable routing

## Monitoring and Reporting

2. **Green Mining Map**: Geographic distribution of renewable miners
3. **Treasury Status**: Fund allocation and impact metrics
4. **Offset Portfolio**: Carbon credit holdings and retirements

### Verification and Auditing

**Automated Verification**:
- Continuous oracle consensus validation
- Real-time REC verification
- Anomaly detection algorithms
- Byzantine fault tolerance

**Manual Verification** (Phase 4 Addition):
- Quarterly Foundation reviews
- Digital signature requirements
- Priority queue for large operations
- Transparent audit trail

### Environmental Reporting

- Net emissions (can be negative)
- Regional emission distributions

## Integration with Core Blockchain

### Block Structure

```rust
pub struct Block {
    pub header: BlockHeader,
    pub transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    pub environmental_data: EnvironmentalData,
    pub oracle_attestations: Vec<OracleAttestation>,
}
```

### Mining Rewards

```rust
pub fn calculate_mining_reward(&self) -> Amount {
    let base_reward = self.get_base_reward();
    let green_bonus = match self.renewable_percentage {
        p if p >= 0.95 => base_reward * 0.75,
        p if p >= 0.75 => base_reward * 0.50,
        p if p >= 0.50 => base_reward * 0.25,
        _ => Amount::ZERO,
    };
    base_reward + green_bonus
}
```

## Security and Reliability
