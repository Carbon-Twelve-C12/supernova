# Environmental Features Implementation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Supernova's environmental features, including emissions tracking, green mining incentives, reporting systems, and governance. With the release of version 0.7.5, significant progress has been made on implementing the environmental features, with the environmental tracking system now approximately 95% complete.

## Implementation Status

As of version 0.7.5, Supernova has implemented the following environmental features:

- ✅ Comprehensive emissions tracking system with geographic attribution (fully implemented)
- ✅ Environmental API with full transaction emissions calculation (fully implemented)
- ✅ Basic green mining incentives with verification (75% complete)
- ✅ Environmental data reporting system (80% complete)
- ⚠️ Environmental treasury system (50% complete)
- ✅ Renewable energy certification verification (fully implemented)
- ⚠️ Offset markets integration (partial implementation)
- ⚠️ Emissions dashboard with visualization (30% complete)

Recent work has focused on resolving compatibility issues in the environmental API and treasury system, enabling accurate tracking of energy usage and carbon emissions. The system now successfully calculates emissions for transactions, blocks, and mining operations with geographic specificity.

## Feature Overview

### 1. Emissions Tracking

Supernova implements a robust emissions tracking system that calculates the carbon footprint of blockchain operations:

- **Transaction Emissions**: Calculates CO2 emissions per transaction based on computational requirements
- **Block Emissions**: Aggregates emissions at the block level with historical tracking
- **Mining Emissions**: Tracks energy consumption and emissions from mining operations
- **Network-Level Metrics**: Provides overall network emissions statistics and trends
- **Geographic Attribution**: Maps emissions to geographic regions based on node locations

### 2. Green Mining Incentives

To promote sustainable mining practices, Supernova implements several incentive mechanisms:

- **Fee Discounts**: Miners using verifiable renewable energy sources receive transaction fee discounts
- **Block Reward Multipliers**: Small additional rewards for green miners (implemented as treasury distributions)
- **REC Integration**: Support for Renewable Energy Certificate verification
- **Priority Transaction Processing**: Preferential treatment for transactions from green miners

### 3. Environmental Treasury

The Environmental Treasury collects and distributes funds for environmental initiatives:

- **Fee Allocation**: A small percentage of transaction fees is allocated to the treasury
- **Governance Framework**: Distributed decision-making for fund allocation
- **Project Categories**: Support for offset purchases, renewable energy investments, and R&D
- **Transparency Reporting**: Public reporting of fund usage and impact

### 4. Reporting and Verification

Supernova's environmental features include comprehensive reporting mechanisms:

- **Miner Certification**: Process for miners to verify their energy sources
- **Emissions Reports**: Regular publication of network-wide emissions data
- **Impact Metrics**: Tracking of emissions reduction achievements
- **API Access**: Public API for accessing environmental data
- **Verification Framework**: Validation of environmental claims

## Technical Implementation

### Emissions Calculation

The core emissions calculation algorithm considers multiple factors:

```rust
/// Calculate emissions for a transaction
pub fn calculate_transaction_emissions(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Emissions {
    let computational_cost = self.estimate_computational_cost(tx);
    let energy_consumption = computational_cost * self.network_efficiency_factor;
    let emissions_factor = self.get_region_emissions_factor(tx.origin_region());
    
    Emissions {
        energy_kwh: energy_consumption,
        co2_grams: energy_consumption * emissions_factor,
        region: tx.origin_region().clone(),
        timestamp: tx.timestamp(),
        category: EmissionsCategory::Transaction,
    }
}
```

### Miner Registration

Miners can register their environmental credentials through the API:

```rust
/// Register a miner with environmental information
pub fn register_miner_energy_source(&mut self, miner_id: &str, energy_info: MinerEnergyInfo) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Verify the provided certificates
    if let Some(ref certificates) = energy_info.certificates {
        if !self.verify_certificates(certificates) {
            return Err("Invalid renewable energy certificates".to_string());
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the green percentage
    let green_percentage = match energy_info.energy_sources.as_ref() {
        Some(sources) => self.calculate_green_percentage(sources),
        None => 0.0,
    };
    
    // Create the environmental profile
    let profile = MinerEnvironmentalProfile {
        miner_id: miner_id.to_string(),
        energy_info,
        green_percentage,
        verified: true,
        last_updated: get_current_timestamp(),
        emissions_factor: self.calculate_emissions_factor(green_percentage),
    };
    
    // Store the profile
    self.miner_profiles.insert(miner_id.to_string(), profile);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Treasury Distribution

The environmental treasury distributes funds according to governance decisions:

```rust
/// Distribute treasury funds to environmental initiatives
pub fn distribute_treasury_funds(&mut self, distributions: Vec<TreasuryDistribution>) -> Result<(), String> {
    let available_funds = self.get_available_funds();
    let total_distribution: u64 = distributions.iter().map(|d| d.amount).sum();
    
    if total_distribution > available_funds {
        return Err(format!(
            "Insufficient funds: requested {}, available {}",
            total_distribution, available_funds
        ));
    }
    
    for distribution in distributions {
        match distribution.target {
            DistributionTarget::OffsetPurchase(project_id) => {
                self.purchase_offsets(project_id, distribution.amount)?;
            },
            DistributionTarget::RenewableInvestment(project_id) => {
                self.invest_in_renewable(project_id, distribution.amount)?;
            },
            DistributionTarget::Research(project_id) => {
                self.fund_research(project_id, distribution.amount)?;
            },
            DistributionTarget::GreenMinerReward(miner_id) => {
                self.reward_green_miner(&miner_id, distribution.amount)?;
            },
        }
        
        // Record the distribution
        self.record_distribution(distribution);
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## API Endpoints
