pub fn verify_quantum_transaction(&self, transaction: &Transaction) -> Result<ValidationResult, ValidationError> {
    if let Some(sig_data) = transaction.signature_data() {
        // Create parameters for verification
        let params = QuantumParameters {
            scheme: match sig_data.scheme {
                SignatureSchemeType::Dilithium => QuantumScheme::Dilithium,
                SignatureSchemeType::Falcon => QuantumScheme::Falcon,
                SignatureSchemeType::Sphincs => QuantumScheme::Sphincs,

                _ => return Ok(ValidationResult::Invalid(ValidationError::InvalidSignatureScheme)),
            },
            security_level: sig_data.security_level,
        };
        
        // Get the message hash
        let msg = transaction.hash();
        
        // Verify the signature
        match verify_quantum_signature(
            &sig_data.public_key,
            &msg,
            &sig_data.data,
            params

## Security Hardening Features

Supernova implements robust security measures to protect against various attack vectors targeting blockchain networks:

### 1. Advanced Eclipse Attack Prevention

#### Peer Diversity Management

- **Subnet Diversity**: Limits connections per IP subnet to prevent attackers from isolating nodes
- **ASN Diversity**: Ensures connections are spread across different network providers
- **Geographic Diversity**: Maintains connections to peers in different geographic regions
- **Shannon Entropy Scoring**: Uses information theory to quantify network diversity

#### Forced Peer Rotation

- **Periodic Rotation**: Forces rotation of a percentage of peers at configurable intervals
- **Intelligent Selection**: Preferentially rotates peers from overrepresented network segments
- **Protected Peers**: Allows designation of critical peers that are never rotated
- **Emergency Rotation**: Triggers immediate rotation when attack patterns are detected

#### Connection Ratio Enforcement

- **Inbound/Outbound Ratio**: Maintains a healthy ratio of inbound to outbound connections
- **Minimum Outbound Connections**: Ensures a configurable minimum number of outbound connections

### 3. Network Security Enhancements

#### Rate Limiting

- **Connection Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid connection attempts from the same source
- **Subnet-level Limiting**: Applies limits at the subnet level to prevent circumvention
- **Adaptive Penalties**: Increases penalties for repeated violations

#### Configuration Options

The security system is highly configurable, allowing operators to adjust parameters based on their security posture:

```toml
[security]
# Eclipse attack prevention
min_diversity_score = 0.7
connection_strategy = "BalancedDiversity"
rotation_interval_seconds = 3600
min_outbound_connections = 8
max_inbound_ratio = 3.0

# Subnet limitations
max_connections_per_subnet = 3
max_connections_per_asn = 8
max_connections_per_region = 15

# Rate limiting
