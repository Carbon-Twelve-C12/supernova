# Energy Efficiency and Environmental Impact Tracking

## Overview

Supernova implements a comprehensive energy efficiency and environmental impact tracking system that measures, reports, and helps mitigate the ecological footprint of blockchain operations. This document explains how Supernova measures energy consumption, calculates carbon emissions, and provides mechanisms for improving the environmental sustainability of the network.

## Energy Consumption Metrics

### Measurement Methodology

Supernova uses a multi-layered approach to measure energy consumption:

1. **Node-Level Monitoring**: Each node measures and reports its own energy consumption
2. **Mining Hardware Profiling**: Different mining hardware configurations are profiled for energy usage
3. **Network-Wide Aggregation**: Individual measurements are aggregated to estimate network-wide consumption
4. **Transaction Energy Attribution**: Energy costs are attributed to individual transactions

### Energy Metrics Collection

Energy data is collected at several levels:

#### Node Level
- CPU power consumption
- Memory usage
- Disk operations
- Network activity
- Idle vs. active power states
- Power supply efficiency

#### Mining Level
- Hashrate-to-energy ratio
- Hardware efficiency metrics
- Thermal output
- Cooling requirements
- Real-time power measurement

#### Network Level
- Total network hashrate
- Geographic distribution of mining
- Energy mix by region
- Peak vs. average consumption
- Transaction throughput relative to energy use

### Energy Calculation Formula

The basic formula for calculating the energy consumption per transaction is:

```
Energy_per_transaction = (Network_energy_consumption_per_day / Transactions_per_day) * Transaction_weight
```

Where:
- `Network_energy_consumption_per_day` is the estimated total energy used by the network in kWh
- `Transactions_per_day` is the average number of transactions processed in a day
- `Transaction_weight` is a factor based on the transaction's computational complexity

For more precise calculations, Supernova uses an advanced model that considers:

```
Transaction_energy = Base_energy + (Input_count * Input_energy) + (Output_count * Output_energy) + (Script_complexity * Script_energy)
```

## Carbon Footprint Tracking

### Carbon Emissions Calculation

Supernova calculates carbon emissions based on energy consumption and the energy sources used:

```
Carbon_emissions = Sum(Energy_consumption_i * Carbon_intensity_i)
```

Where:
- `Energy_consumption_i` is the energy consumed from source i
- `Carbon_intensity_i` is the carbon intensity of energy source i (kg CO2e/kWh)

### Regional Energy Mix Consideration

The system considers the regional energy mix where mining operations occur:

1. **Energy Source Registration**: Miners can register their energy sources
2. **Grid Mix Analysis**: For unregistered miners, regional grid mix data is used
3. **Carbon Intensity Database**: Regularly updated database of carbon intensities by region
4. **Seasonal Variations**: Consideration of seasonal changes in energy mix

### Real-Time Carbon Intensity

Supernova integrates with real-time carbon intensity APIs to provide accurate emissions data based on:
- Time of day
- Regional grid conditions
- Renewable energy availability
- Local weather conditions affecting renewable generation

3. **Environmental Reputation Score**: Miners build a reputation based on environmental performance
4. **Renewable Energy Verification**: Process to verify renewable energy claims

The incentive structure includes:

| Renewable Percentage | Fee Discount | Transaction Priority |
|----------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 95-100%              | 10%          | Highest              |
| 75-94%               | 7%           | High                 |
| 50-74%               | 5%           | Medium               |
| 25-49%               | 2%           | Normal               |
| 0-24%                | 0%           | Normal               |
