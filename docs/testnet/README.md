# Supernova Testnet Documentation

This directory contains all documentation related to the Supernova blockchain testnet deployment, setup, and troubleshooting.

## Contents

- **TESTNET_SETUP.md**: Complete instructions for setting up and running the testnet
- **TESTNET_SUMMARY.md**: Overview of the current testnet implementation and limitations
- **TESTNET_FIXES.md**: Original fixes made to resolve issues with the testnet deployment
- **TESTNET_FIXES_UPDATED.md**: Updated fixes and improvements to the testnet
- **FINAL_SOLUTION.md**: Docker-based solution for testnet deployment

## Current Status

The Supernova testnet is currently implemented as a Docker-based simulation environment. It provides a functional demonstration platform while core blockchain components are being developed.

### Key Features

- Multi-node network simulation
- Mock mining capabilities
- Environmental impact tracking
- Testnet launcher with simple commands
- Interactive CLI client

### Known Limitations

- Uses simulated nodes rather than fully functional blockchain nodes
- Limited implementation of advanced features
- Mock networking rather than actual P2P protocols

## Quick Start

For the quickest deployment experience, use the Docker setup:

```bash
# Run the Docker setup script
bash scripts/setup_docker.sh

# Navigate to testnet directory
cd deployments/testnet

# Start the testnet
docker-compose up -d
```

## Future Development

The testnet will be gradually enhanced as core blockchain components are completed. Future enhancements include:

1. Replacing mock nodes with actual SuperNova nodes
2. Implementing real P2P communication between nodes
3. Adding full quantum-resistant cryptography support
4. Integrating environmental monitoring features
5. Adding Lightning Network capabilities
