# Supernova Implementation Status

## Version 0.9.0-BETA

As of June 2023, the Supernova blockchain has reached version 0.9.0-BETA, with significant progress in resolving all compilation issues and implementing core functionality. The project is now in a beta state where all components compile successfully and many core features are fully operational.

## Major Milestones Achieved

1. **Compilation Success**: All compilation errors have been resolved, and the codebase builds successfully.
2. **Module Structure Improvement**: Enhanced organization of module imports and exports, particularly fixing circular dependencies.
3. **Network Module Implementation**: Implemented proper stubs for network components.
4. **Core Library Completion**: The btclib core library now provides all essential blockchain functionality.
5. **Environmental Tracking**: Complete implementation of carbon emissions tracking and incentive mechanisms.
6. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Full integration of post-quantum signature schemes.
